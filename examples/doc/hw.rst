Hardware development platforms
------------------------------

For initial development of single Ethernet port AVB applications the following XMOS
development platform is recommended:

  * `XK-AVB-LC-SYS AVB Audio Endpoint <http://www.xmos.com/products/reference-designs/avb>`_


It is recommended to have at least two boards for developing streaming audio applications. It is also recommended that an AVB compatible network switch be obtained and used while developing the system.

For developing an application specific board for AVB please
refer to the hardware guides for the above boards which contain example
schematics, BOMs, design guidelines etc.
